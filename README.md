# Prime and Composite Number Checker

This Python script allows users to input a range [A, B] and identifies prime and composite numbers within that range. It provides a count of prime and composite numbers and displays whether each number within the range is prime or composite.

## Project Overview

The script prompts the user to enter values for the range [A, B]. It then iterates through each number in this range, determining whether each number is prime or composite. Prime numbers are those divisible only by 1 and themselves, while composite numbers have more than two positive divisors.

## Features

- **Input Range**: Users can specify the range [A, B] to check for prime and composite numbers.
- **Prime Detection**: Identifies and prints prime numbers within the specified range.
- **Composite Detection**: Identifies and prints composite numbers within the specified range.
- **Counting**: Calculates and displays the total count of prime and composite numbers found in the range.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. **Input Range**: Enter values for A and B when prompted.
3. **View Results**: See the classification of each number in the specified range as prime or composite and the total count of each.

## Example Output

For example, if A = 1 and B = 10, the script would output:For Range [1,10]
1, is neither Prime nor Composite
2 is Prime
3 is Prime
4 is Composite
5 is Prime
6 is Composite
7 is Prime
8 is Composite
9 is Composite
10 is Composite
4 Prime and 6 Composite numbers in the range
